            <p>As a member of my University's Mars Rover team, I've been involved with the 
                design and manufacturing of a small scale rover, which competes in an annual
                competition in simulated Martian terrain. For the past 2 years I've been on the 
                sample acquisition subteam, and I was given responsibilty of packaging the subsystem into
                an end effector this year. It uses a mix of traditional milling and 3d printing to contain a motor, a uv light,
                sensors, and a mechanical contamination safeguard in a volume that's roughly 2 tuna cans. Along with sample collection,
                it's also capable of focusing a usb camera and a triad spectroscopy sensor onto areas of interest. The spectroscopy sensor
                requires consistent light conditions, so a compliant shroud was deisgned and printed to acheive that requirement.

            <p>Taking on the role of SA lead was ultimately a sequel to the previous work I did on the team. For the 2022-23 season
                I created a full Sample Acqusition for the rover. Drawing from the previous year's work, I settled on a 3 DOF robotic arm to 
                transfer samples from the environment to the onboard testing module, dubbed ISH. I was responsible for the 3 joints and segments, 
                and I managed the team that worked on the subtask of creating the end effector. It has roughly the same capabilities of the previous
                year's system, but with the shift to a dedicated robotic arm it can be attached/detached from the rover within a minute. This unitilized 
                3 axis CNC machining to create robust yet lightweight components for the most load-bearing joints.

            <p>The primary goal of Micigan Neuroprosthetics is to develop low cost 3d printed prosthetic
                arms for disabled children who aren't able to obtain more expensive prosthetics.
                Each arm is customized for the individual user, and we work closely with them during the design
                process to ensure it'll suit that child's needs. I've mainly stayed on the mechanical side of the team,
                where I've worked on projects such as allowing a hand attachment to detach from the forearm, 
                a mechanically actuated finger, and a force sensitive compliant fingertip.

            <p> For the task I was assigned during the winter semester of 2023, I needed to redesign the manipulandum used
                to collect hand movement data from an NHP subject. Compared to mocap devices, the postion of the potentiometers are guarunteed
                to follow the actual finger movementrs of the subject. After iterating on the previous design used in the lab,
                I was able to retain all the functionality of the previous model while improving the bias of the motion data, in addition to reducing the 
                mass by 30%. It was designed in Fusion 360 using a combination of machining and SLA resin printing. To introduce controlled
                variables, the finger sleeves can be fixed at regular 10 degree intervals, together, or they can have a torsional spring force applied.

            <p>As one of the major components of the Mechanical Engineering curriculum at the University of Michigan, 
                MECHENG 250 is focused on designing and manufacturing a robotic vehicle, meant to accomplish
                certain tasks in a short amount of time. In addition to the CAD experience gained in this course, manufacturing
                methods such as milling, lathing, and fdm protytping were used to demonstrate concepts taught in the lecture.
                Our robot was designed to collect 5 3d printed blocks, which wore stored in a helical drum that raised it roughly 9 
                inches to the desired depositing level. The majority of the RMP was 3d printed, and the on board printing time of all 
                the parts was roughly 40 hours.

            <p>At the start of the pandemic, I took it upon myself to find a platform I could gain a baseline understanding
                of robotics on, without spending hundreds of dollars. While I was able to find an exisitng design for a scaled down
                version of Boston Dynamic's spot, it lacked any documentation on the wiring, power requirements, or software development
                needed to get it on its feet. Once I got past those obstacles, I was able to test algorithms I was learning about
                for gait control on a platform that cost less than 80 dollars. It's powered by an arduino mega and a servo cntrol board, which are both
                powered by a regulated 7.4V power supply. Each leg has 3 actuators, which give it the range of motion necessary to stand up, maintain
                balance, and in the event of a fall, right itself.

            <p> Once I became more adjusted to using blender as a 3d sketchpad, I tried working my way into a more oraganic modeling theme, with 
                this being the first attempt. It's a cross sectional view of a kidney, with the primary anatomy being displayed in an easy to see manner.
                Ideally, it would be able to be saved as a 3d file and opened by a medical professional, who might want to use it to explain something
                with the aid of an interactive visual.

            <br>
            <p>In February 2021, I enetered my University's Makeathon, which gave students everything they needed to
                create solutions to an existing problem in a 36-hour time frame. I developed a drop off point for delivery services like 
                UberEats or Doordash to leave their delivery on, and it would email the homeowner that their food was delivered. It would 
                also send an email when the food was picked up, meaning that it would be easier to report thefts if you had
                a timestamp of exactly when the delivery went missing. In the end, I received an award based upon my usage of 
                generative design in the development of this prototype.

            <p>Like MECHENG 250, the goal of MECHENG 350 is to teach about how we should be designing systems in order to
                minimize failure and maximize efficiency. The lab component serves as a demonstration of the lecture content,
                and it's focused on designing an item sorting mechanism that deposits discs into specificed zones based upon color, using 
                topics such as PID control and inertial matching to speed up its cycle time.
