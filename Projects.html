            <p> As an intern at iRobot during the summer after my junior year in undergrad, I was able to see both ends of the design process
                from first principle design phases, where compoennts were being interfaced into a single top down assembly, to the final stages
                of First Article Inspection from oversea manufacturing operations. One of the projects I worked on used an Instron to characterize the hysteresis
                in existing suspension systems on Roombas and compared it to the hysteresis seen in SLS prototypes. Besides the wide range of projects I was assigned,
                my intern cohort was encouraged to spend 10% of our time there on personal research, where we could use the HQ facilities with essentially free roam to develop
                within our own interests. For me, this saw the form of a concussion tracker, show below.

            <br>
            <p> Outside of work, I started training martial arts. For sports that had higher risks of head trauma, CTE is a known side effect, but its long term onset and 
                diagnoses makes it a significant concern for anyone starting out. There's no set amount of concussions that would cause it, which makes it that much harder to track.
                I prototyped a solution that housed an arduino, IMU breakout, and a display into an attachable module that could fit onto the back of headgear in order to log impulses and 
                notify the user if it suspected a traumatic hit was taken. Over time, it would also be able to assess larger volumes of lower impacts to give a similar warning. My goal was to 
                add a better way of protecting athletes without primitve concussion/ko counting methods. After I prototpyed the housing at iRobot's facilities,
                I learned that the Arduino nano esp 32 has a 6dof SMD IMU, solving the packaging constraints I ran into with a dedicated breakout.

            <p> This is a project I'm in the middle of to practice algorithms in CV I'm reading through, making this platform 
                took about 4 hours of work and 6 hours of printing, and it's just a matter of integrating it with openCV. While I developed the raw system on an arduino,
                This needs to be replatformed to a raspberry pi to handle the image processing with openCV. My end goal is to detect and target objects with the 2DOF laser. 
                The steppers have a resolution of 1.5 degrees, which will necessitate an actuator upgrade past 10m once I start testing recognition.

            <p> This was a very brief project I did to try prototyping with ICs. After ensuring I knew how its oscillating function worked on a breadboard, I transferred the design to a protoboard.

            <p>As a member of my University's Mars Rover team, I've been involved with the 
                design and manufacturing of a small scale rover, which competes in an annual
                competition in simulated Martian terrain. For the past 2 years I've been on the 
                sample acquisition subteam, and I was given responsibilty of packaging the subsystem into
                an end effector this year. It uses a mix of traditional milling and 3d printing to contain a motor, a uv light,
                sensors, and a mechanical contamination safeguard in a volume that's roughly 2 tuna cans. Along with sample collection,
                it's also capable of focusing a usb camera and a triad spectroscopy sensor onto areas of interest. The spectroscopy sensor
                requires consistent light conditions, so a compliant shroud was deisgned and printed to acheive that requirement.

            <p>Taking on the role of SA lead was ultimately a sequel to the previous work I did on the team. For the 2022-23 season
                I created a full Sample Acqusition for the rover. Drawing from the previous year's work, I settled on a 3 DOF robotic arm to 
                transfer samples from the environment to the onboard testing module, dubbed ISH. I was responsible for the 3 joints and segments, 
                and I managed the team that worked on the subtask of creating the end effector. It has roughly the same capabilities of the previous
                year's system, but with the shift to a dedicated robotic arm it can be attached/detached from the rover within a minute. This unitilized 
                3 axis CNC machining to create robust yet lightweight components for the most load-bearing joints.

            <p> As a Senior advising member, I filled the shoes of the past graduates who helped me on the team in years prior. The SA system pivoted back 
                to a cartesion system, where the XY rails positioned a vertically aligned end effector stage. Due to a change in the URC rules, our end effector 
                cored our sample instead of scooping it, which worked better for compacted, unprepared samples. I designed and manufactured the humidity sensor deployment arm, which 
                solved the problem of deploying a 12 inch probe from a 12 inch packaging constraint.  I

                arms for disabled children who aren't able to obtain more expensive prosthetics.
                Each arm is customized for the individual user, and we work closely with them during the design
                process to ensure it'll suit that child's needs. I've mainly stayed on the mechanical side of the team,
                where I've worked on projects such as allowing a hand attachment to detach from the forearm, 
                a mechanically actuated finger, and a force sensitive compliant fingertip.

            <p> For the task I was assigned during the winter semester of 2023, I needed to redesign the manipulandum used
                to collect hand movement data from an NHP subject. Compared to mocap devices, the postion of the potentiometers are guarunteed
                to follow the actual finger movementrs of the subject. After iterating on the previous design used in the lab,
                I was able to retain all the functionality of the previous model while improving the bias of the motion data, in addition to reducing the 
                mass by 30%. It was designed in Fusion 360 using a combination of machining and SLA resin printing. To introduce controlled
                variables, the finger sleeves can be fixed at regular 10 degree intervals, together, or they can have a torsional spring force applied.

                MECHENG 250 is focused on designing and manufacturing a robotic vehicle, meant to accomplish
                certain tasks in a short amount of time. In addition to the CAD experience gained in this course, manufacturing
                methods such as milling, lathing, and fdm protytping were used to demonstrate concepts taught in the lecture.
                Our robot was designed to collect 5 3d printed blocks, which wore stored in a helical drum that raised it roughly 9 
                inches to the desired depositing level. The majority of the RMP was 3d printed, and the on board printing time of all 
                the parts was roughly 40 hours.

            <p>At the start of the pandemic, I took it upon myself to find a platform I could gain a baseline understanding
                of robotics on, without spending hundreds of dollars. While I was able to find an exisitng design for a scaled down
                version of Boston Dynamic's spot, it lacked any documentation on the wiring, power requirements, or software development
                needed to get it on its feet. Once I got past those obstacles, I was able to test algorithms I was learning about
                for gait control on a platform that cost less than 80 dollars. It's powered by an arduino mega and a servo control board, which are both
                powered by a regulated 7.4V power supply. Each leg has 3 actuators, which give it the range of motion necessary to stand up, maintain
                balance, and in the event of a fall, right itself.

                UberEats or Doordash to leave their delivery on, and it would email the homeowner that their food was delivered. It would 
                also send an email when the food was picked up, meaning that it would be easier to report thefts if you had
                a timestamp of exactly when the delivery went missing. In the end, I received an award based upon my usage of
