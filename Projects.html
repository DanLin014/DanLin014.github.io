            <p>As a member of my University's Mars Rover team, I've been involved with the 
                design and manufacturing of a small scale rover, which competes in an annual
                competition in simulated Martian terrain. For the past 2 years I've been on the 
                sample acquisition subteam, and I was given responsibilty of packaging the subsystem into
                an end effector this year.

            </div>
            <br>
            <p>The primary goal of Micigan Neuroprosthetics is to develop low cost 3d printed prosthetic
                arms for disabled children who aren't able to obtain more expensive prosthetics.
                Each arm is customized for the individual user, and we work closely with them during the design
                process to ensure it'll suit that child's needs. I've mainly stayed on the mechanical side of the team,
                where I've worked on projects such as allowing a hand attachment to detach from the forearm, 
                mechanically actuated finger, and a force sensitive compliant fingertip.

            </div>
            <br>
            <p>As one of the major components of the Mechanical Engineering curriculum at the University of Michigan, 
                MECHENG 250 is focused on designing and manufacturing a robotic vehicle, meant to accomplish
                certain tasks in a short amount of time. In addition to the CAD experience gained in this course, manufacturing
                methods such as milling, lathing, and fdm protytping were used to demonstrate concepts taught in the lecture.

            <p>At the start of the pandemic, I took it upon myself to find a platform I could gain a baseline understanding
                of robotics on, without spending hundreds of dollars. While I was able to find an exisitng design for a scaled down
                version of Boston Dynamic's spot, it lacked any documentation on the wiring, power requirements, or software development
                needed to get it on its feet. Once I got past those obstacles, I was able to test algorithms I was learning about
                for gait control on a platform that cost less than 80 dollars.

            <h1><strong>Makeathon 2021</strong></h1>
            <div class="row gtr-10 gtr-uniform">
                <div class="col-12-medium"><span class="image left"><img src="images/grips-1.png" alt="" /></span></div>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>In February 2021, I enetered my University's Makeathon, which gave students everything they needed to
                create solutions to an existing problem in a 36-hour time frame. I developed a drop off point for delivery services like 
                UberEats or Doordash to leave their delivery on, and it would email the homeowner that their food was delivered. It would 
                also send an email when the food was picked up, meaning that it would be easier to report thefts if you had
                a timestamp of exactly when the delivery went missing. In the end, I received an award based upon my usage of 
                generative design in the development of this.

            <div class="row gtr-10 gtr-uniform">
                <div class="col-12-medium"><span class="image left"><img src="images/350-1.PNG" alt="" /></span></div>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>Like MECHENG 250, the goal of MECHENG 350 is to teach about how we should be designing systems in order to
                minimize failure and maximize efficiency. The lab component serves as a demonstration of the lecture content,
                and it's focused on designing an item sorting mechanism that deposits discs into specificed zones based upon color, using 
                topics such as PID control and inertial matching to speed up its cycle time.
