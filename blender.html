            <h2>Why I learned Blender</h2>
            <p> I first heard about it in high school, roughly a year after I started learning CAD. Instead of rigid extrusions and rotated features,
                models were meshes. This differing approch to representing 3d models gave me the flexibilty I needed to express my ideas through a more
                forgiving medium compared to CAD. At least, that's what I thought when I started learning blender. Art never came easily to me, so animation seemed like a fruitless
                skill to pursue if I was staying in STEM. It wasn't until I spent more time with it to busy myself during 2020 that the capabilities started to compliment my 
                academic goals. Sketching doesn't come naturally to me, so I avoid throwing my scratch work into a presentation for design proposals if possible. Instead, I've figured out how 
                to work between CAD and Blender to create production quality renders that have manufacutrable CAD as its backbone. On the more creative side of things, 
                it's become the only art medium I've enjoyed working with. This is more or less a wall of my progress throughout the past 3 years.
        
            </p>

               Update: I've left the above for reference, but I sketch now after being inspired by one of my friends. Things change I guess, see the sketches tab for more.
